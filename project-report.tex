% 2. Problem Statement Section
\section{Problem Statement}
\subsection{Problem}
The DAEN program faces significant challenges in evaluating program effectiveness as this represents the first systematic effort to gather alumni feedback. The absence of a centralized alumni database and limited alumni engagement mechanisms create substantial obstacles in reaching program graduates. The research revealed several critical issues:
\begin{itemize}
\item Limited Cloud Technology Exposure: While most alumni work extensively with cloud platforms in their current roles, many received insufficient exposure to these technologies during their coursework.
\item Theoretical vs. Practical Balance: Alumni consistently highlighted a need for more hands-on projects, indicating a gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.
\item Emerging Technology Integration: The curriculum requires updates to incorporate emerging industry trends such as AI Ethics, DataOps, and Machine Learning Operations.
\item Alumni Engagement: Establishing and maintaining contact with program graduates poses a significant challenge, impacting the program's ability to gather comprehensive feedback.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Scope}
This 15-week research project encompassed the development of interview methodology, conduct of alumni interviews, and comprehensive data analysis. The project faced significant initial challenges in establishing contact with alumni, as no centralized database existed. Over 50 alumni were contacted through LinkedIn, resulting in 14 successful interviews. The scope included:
\begin{itemize}
\item Development of structured interview questions
\item Implementation of data collection protocols
\item Creation of data processing pipeline
\item Analysis and visualization of collected data
\item Compilation of program improvement recommendations
\end{itemize}
A valuable outcome of this research is the creation of an initial alumni contact database, which will be shared with the GMU alumni office to facilitate future engagement efforts.

% 3. Data Section
\section{Data}
\subsection{Data Product - Questions}
The research design centered on a carefully structured set of interview questions designed to capture comprehensive insights about alumni experiences and outcomes. The questions were developed to gather both quantitative and qualitative data across several key domains:
\begin{itemize}
\item Academic Profile Assessment (Questions 1-2)
\item Career Progression Tracking (Questions 3-6)
\item Technical Skill Utilization (Questions 4, 7)

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Collection Process}
The data collection process followed a systematic approach designed to ensure consistency and quality:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Alumni Identification}
\begin{itemize}
\item LinkedIn network search using DAEN program keywords
\item Referral requests from identified alumni
\item Collaboration with faculty for alumni contacts
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Interview Platforms}
\begin{itemize}
\item MS Teams (primary platform)
\item Zoom (secondary platform)
\item LinkedIn messaging (alternative option)
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Recording Methods}
\begin{itemize}
\item Audio recordings (Teams and Zoom)

\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Data Security}
\begin{itemize}
\item Secure storage of recordings
\item Confidential handling of personal information
\item Anonymous processing of responses
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Data Process}
The data processing pipeline consisted of several structured stages:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Storage and Security}
\begin{itemize}
\item Upload to AWS S3 bucket
\item Encryption of sensitive data
\item Access control implementation
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Transcription}
\begin{itemize}
\item AWS Transcribe processing
\item Manual verification of transcripts
\item Format standardization
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Data Extraction}
\begin{itemize}
\item NLP toolkit implementation

\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Structure and Format}
\begin{itemize}
\item CSV file creation with 15 primary columns
\item Data transformation for visualization
\item Quality control checks
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Quality}
Interview-based research inherently presents various potential biases and data quality challenges that must be carefully considered and addressed. Drawing from established research methodology literature (Bergelson et al., 2022; Nikiforova, 2020) and implementing practical measures in our research process, we established the following quality control framework:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Interview Structure Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Utilized a standardized set of 11 structured questions asked in the same order for all participants
\item Questions were designed to be neutral and open-ended to avoid leading the respondents
\item Interviewers maintained consistent protocols by not prompting or suggesting answers
\item Each interview followed the same format regardless of platform (MS Teams, Zoom, or written surveys)
\item Responses were accepted as given without attempting to influence or modify them
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Data Collection Quality Controls}
\begin{itemize}
\item Recorded all interviews (audio or text) with participant permission
\item Used AWS Transcribe consistently across all audio recordings to ensure uniform transcription quality
\item Applied the same NLP toolkit for all text extraction to maintain processing consistency
\item Implemented systematic data extraction procedures using local natural language processing tools
\item Maintained standardized formats for data storage and processing
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Data Processing Standards}
\begin{itemize}
\item Created a uniform CSV structure with 15 standardized columns for all interview data
\item Applied consistent text preprocessing tasks across all responses
\item Used automated Python scripts in AWS SageMaker for standardizing string formats
\item Implemented systematic handling of multiple responses through column expansion
\item Maintained data anonymity through consistent identifier formatting (CEC-DAEN-[Graduation Year]-[MS/Cert]-[Sequence Number])
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Quality Verification Procedures}
\begin{itemize}
\item Conducted human review of ambiguous responses
\item Filtered out unclear or inconsistent terminology
\item Applied standardized categorization for job titles based on industry classifications
\item Mapped similar technologies to standardized categories through comprehensive research
\item Verified data transformations through multiple review cycles
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
To ensure consistency and minimize bias in our data collection and processing:
\begin{itemize}
\item Interviewers proceeded systematically through questions without deviation
\item No additional prompting or clarifying questions were used that might influence responses
\item Raw responses were preserved in their original form before any processing
\item All data processing steps were documented and applied uniformly
\item Standardization procedures were based on established industry classifications rather than subjective interpretations
\end{itemize}
This systematic approach to data quality management was implemented to ensure that our findings would accurately represent the alumni feedback while minimizing potential biases or inconsistencies in data collection and processing.

\section{Research Biases and Data Quality Considerations}
In conducting this alumni interview research, we identified several key sources of potential bias and inaccuracy that could impact our findings. Despite implementing systematic controls, these factors should be considered when interpreting the results:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Selection Bias}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sample limited to LinkedIn-active alumni from 2019-2023
\item Response rate of 14 out of 50 contacted alumni
\item Potential over-representation of successful graduates
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Data Accuracy}
\begin{itemize}
\item Memory recall variations depending on graduation year
\item Standardization requirements for technical terminology
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
While these limitations exist, our methodological controls and transparent reporting help maintain the integrity of the findings while acknowledging areas for potential improvement in future research.
