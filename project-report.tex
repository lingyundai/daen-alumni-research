% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
The effectiveness of the DAEN program at George 
Mason University is critical as the department aim to provide industry-relevant education, focusing on tools, technologies, and skills that are directly applicable in professional roles. This study presents analysis of the DAEN program at the College of Computing and Engineering at George Mason University, examining industry demands and program effectiveness through comprehensive alumni feedback. The research is conducted through alumni interviews. The interviews are designed with structured qualitative and quantitative questions to evaluate various aspects of program alumni including academic profile, employment trajectories, technical skill utilization in jobs, program technical skill utilization, and program feedback. Data was collected through anonymous interview recordings in either audio or text format based on the interview platform used. Audio interview recordings were processed confidentially using AWS transcribe to generate text transcripts. The text transcripts were cleaned and extracted into columns in a CSV file using local natural language processing toolkit. The data was visualized using Tableau to identify patterns in employment outcomes,

% 2. Problem Statement Section
\section{Problem Statement}
\subsection{Alumni Feedback}
There are 14 alumni participated in the interview who graduated between year of 2019 and 2023. From the 14 alumni interviewed, the average program rating is 3.7 out of 5, the average number of jobs held after graduation is 2 jobs. Data Analyst emerges as the most prevalent job title. The most frequently used technologies are python and SQL, the most frequently used cloud platform is AWS, the most used tools are Power BI and Tableau. The common area for program improvement reported by the 14 alumni are more hands-on projects, cloud, and practical application. 


\subsection{Focus}
The study aims to evaluate the gap between the most used skills in alumni career and the most valuable skills acquired in the program. The study also aims to identify the areas for program improvement and how well the program prepared alumni for their career.

\subsection{Problem}
The DAEN program faces significant challenges in evaluating program effectiveness as this represents the first systematic effort to gather alumni feedback. The absence of a centralized alumni database and limited alumni engagement mechanisms make it difficult to reach and collect comprehensive feedback from program graduates. After the alumni feedback was gathered and processed, some key problems with the program was discovered. First, the data reveals that while most alumni work with cloud platforms in their current roles, many received limited exposure to cloud technologies during their coursework. Second, there is a significant demand for hands-on projects as many alumni prefer the courseworks to be less theoretical but more practical. Additionally, alumni highlighted several emerging industry trends that should be incorporated into the curriculum, including AI Ethics, DataOps, and Machine Learning Operations, to better align with current market demands. These challenges must be addressed to maintain the program's effectiveness in preparing graduates for successful careers.

% 3. Data Section
\section{Data}
\subsection{Collection Process}
The data collection process was conducted through structured interviews with program alumni. Alumni were identified and contacted through LinkedIn for interview scheduling. The interviews were conducted through multiple platforms based on alumni preferences: MS Teams, Zoom, or written surveys via LinkedIn. MS Teams interviews were recorded in both audio and text formats, Zoom sessions were captured in audio format, while LinkedIn surveys were collected as text documents. Each interview followed a standardized set of 12 questions to ensure unbiased and consistent data collection, covering academic background, career trajectory, technical skill utilization, and program evaluation. Interviews were conducted remotely and recorded with permission. All alumni personal information, including names and contact details, remained confidential to maintain privacy and data integrity throughout the study. 

\subsection{Questions}
The interviews were structured with the following 12 questions and asked in the same order for each participating alumni:

1. What year and semester did you graduate from the DAEN program? 

This question aims to establish the basic understanding of alumni's academic profile.

2. Did you receive an M.S. or Certificate? 

This question aims to establish further understanding of alumni's academic profile based on degree type achieved.

3. What was the title of your first job, the name of the company, and the general responsibilities?

This question collects information on alumni's initial employment trajectory post-graduation including job title, company name, and responsibilities to identify career progression.

4. What technologies and tools did you use for this job title? 

The question collects information on the most used technologies and tools in alumni's first job post-graduation to help identify industry trends.

5. What is your current job title, the name of the company and the general responsibilities?

This question collects information on alumni's current employment trajectory post-graduation including job title, company name, and responsibilities to identify career progression.

6. How many jobs have you had since you graduated? 

This question aims to establish the average number of jobs held by alumni post-graduation to identify employment trends.

7. List the most used technologies/tools in your career. (E.g. Programming language, framework, cloud, ML) 

This question collects information on the most used technologies and tools in alumni's career post-graduation to help identify industry trends.

8. What knowledge and skills that you acquired in the DAEN program have been the most valuable to your career? Can you specify the concepts/methodologies/technologies that were most valuable? 

This question aims to identify the most valuable skills acquired in the DAEN program that are directly applicable in alumni's professional roles.

9. If DAEN program provided these specific courses, topics, or training, I would have been more prepared in my careerâ€¦ 

This question aims to identify areas for program improvement based on alumni feedback.

10. How well did the DAEN courses prepare you for your career? (Scale: 1 -- Not well at all, 5 -- Very good) 

This question aims to evaluate the program's effectiveness in qualitative format in preparing graduates for industry demands.

11. Have you completed any courses/certifications since you graduated from the DAEN program? 

This question aims to identify alumni's continuous learning and professional development post-graduation.

\subsection{Data Process}
The interview recordings were uploaded into the AWS S3 bucket for secure storage and processing. Audio recordings were converted to text using AWS Transcribe, while maintaining confidentiality throughout the process. To ensure anonymity, each alumni was assigned a unique identifier following the format CEC-DAEN-[Graduation Year]-[MS/Cert]-[Sequence Number]. The transcript data was processed using a local NLP toolkit to systematically extract relevant information through text tokenization, pattern matching, and keyword extraction techniques. This automated extraction process helped identify and categorize key information from the interview responses. The processed interview data was structured into 15 columns in a CSV file including: Alumni ID, Graduation Year, Degree Type, Total Jobs, Job Titles, Job Companies, Technologies Used, Tools Used, DAEN Program Courses, DAEN Program Technologies, DAEN Program Tools, DAEN Program Rating, DAEN Program Valuable Skills, DAEN Program Potential Improvements, and Course Certifications Completed. The CSV file was saved into the AWS S3 bucket and processed using custom Python script in AWS SageMaker. The script performs basic text preprocessing tasks, including removing empty spaces and standardizing string formats. To handle cases where alumni provided multiple program ratings, the script calculates their average value for consistent analysis. To facilitate data visualization in Tableau, the script transforms comma-separated values in multiple columns into separate numbered columns - for example, splitting a single job\_titles column containing multiple job titles into distinct columns such as job\_title\_1, job\_title\_2. This transformation expanded the original 15 columns into 62 columns, creating a structured format that is Tableau-compatible.
\subsection{Data Quality}
The alumni responses are based on self-reported data, which may introduce bias or inaccuracies. To mitigate this potential limitation, interview questions were carefully designed to be clear and concise. To minimize interviewer influence, interviewers proceeded systematically through questions after each response was completed. Any responses containing ambiguous terminology were filtered out through human review and excluded from the analysis. To enable more meaningful data visualization and trend analysis, similar job titles and technologies were mapped to standardized categories through comprehensive research and human review. Job titles were consolidated based on standard industry classifications from job platforms like Indeed and LinkedIn - for example, business analyst, senior data analyst, and data analyst were all categorized as data analyst. Similarly, technologies were standardized by their core functionality - for instance, different SQL implementations including Oracle SQL, PostgreSQL, and MySQL were grouped under the broader category of SQL.

\section{Analysis}
Analysis was conducted using Tableau visualizations of the processed interview data from 14 DAEN alumni. The data reveals several key patterns: the largest cohort graduated in 2020 (5 alumni), all participants held MS degrees, and most had held two jobs since graduation. Data Analyst emerged as the most common job title, while employment companies showed diverse distribution with no dominant industry pattern. In terms of technical skills, SQL, Python, and AWS dominated as the most utilized technologies, while MS Power BI, Tableau, and MS Excel were the most commonly used tools. Regarding program evaluation, DAEN 690 and Database courses received the highest value ratings, with SQL and Python being the most beneficial technologies learned. Machine learning and database systems stood out as the most valuable tools acquired from the program. The program received positive feedback with most alumni rating it 4 out of 5. Alumni particularly valued database and data modeling skills gained from the program, while suggesting enhancements in cloud computing coverage and hands-on project opportunities. Post-graduation certifications and additional courses showed wide variation with no significant patterns emerging.
